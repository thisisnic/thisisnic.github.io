<p>A colleague asked for my opinion on 2 packages; <code>loggit</code> and <code>futile.logger</code>. Whilst I have used <code>futile.logger</code> before, I hadn’t used <code>loggit</code> and so used the metrics of the package to evaluate the package itself.</p>
<p>The <code>packagemetrics</code> package allows us to generate a number of metrics about a package, so we can compare them. The first thing I do is call <code>package_list_metrics()</code> to get metrics about these
two packages. I’ve changed the shape of the table, just so it’s easier to read in this blog post.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(packagemetrics)
library(dplyr)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>pkg_df &lt;- package_list_metrics(c(&quot;loggit&quot;, &quot;futile.logger&quot;))
as_data_frame(t(pkg_df), rownames = &quot;stat&quot;) </code></pre>

<p>You can see from the table that the last publication date for <code>loggit</code> is April 2018 whereas for <code>futile.logger</code> it is July 2016. It can be quite hard to gain much from this metric; whereas more recent updates can suggest active development and ongoing improvements to functionality, a lack of update may indicate that a package has reached a stable state.</p>
<p>Reverse dependencies, however, tells us a lot more; if a package has a high number of reverse dependencies, one might conclude that there is a higher degree of trust in it in the community, but also more importantly, that it has been exposed to a higher number of users and therefore be less likely to have undiscovered bug. This is also true for the number of downloads.</p>
<p>The second half of the values in the table are blank, implying that futile.logger isn’t on GitHub. For me, if this were true, it’d be a cause for concern as I’d like to be able to see the number of open issues and how recent updates were. However, a quick Google search tells me that futile.logger is in fact on GitHub, but just not linked to in its CRAN page.</p>
<p>Reading GitHub issues pages is fairly simple. Rather than read every issue in detail, I try to get a rough idea of what’s going on, by skimming through. Typically a large number of issues tend to stem from user questions and enhancement requests, so just looking at the raw numbers isn’t enough.</p>
<p><img src="/images/futile.logger-issues.png" width="50%" /></p>
<p>Looking through the open issues for <code>futile.logger</code>, the package authors has already flagged a couple of items as bugs, reducing my work. They appear to be do with namespacing issues, so certainly something to be aware of although not necessarily important.</p>
<p>Going to the equivalent page for <code>loggit</code>, I see that there is only one ticket open, but has been flagged as an enhancement. However, fewer issues is not necessarily a sign of package quality, as it cannot be decoupled from package popularity.</p>
<p><img src="/images/loggit-issues.png" width="50%" /></p>
<p>At this point, I could go on, and explore the source code for each package, but at this point I feel it’d lead to diminishing returns. The conclusion I draw and pass on to my colleague is that both packages seem to be functional with no glaring issues. As I’ve used <code>futile.logger</code> before, and it seems to be more widely used, I’d lean towards that one. My colleague thanks me for my advice and goes with <code>loggit</code> anyway because he’s used it before on a project and it worked pretty well there, which is fair enough.</p>
<p>Package metrics can be a useful source of information about a package, but ultimately, there’s no substitute for experience. Other logging packages are available; these were merely the ones I’d heard of.</p>
